# Arduino-DUE-VCU
A VCU design to run control processes in an EV conversion on Arduino DUE 

Like i showed i developed a V1 of DUE VCU design. It was built on the base of 48pin (2x 24pin) connector in an aluminum box. I shuffled outputs a bit so i cleared the dubious pins. I tested it and it looks good. My goal is to develop the code for this board which would be able to run Chademo process a BMS or use it as VCU.
